Whether you’re tracking bugs, planning features, or monitoring project progress, the default issue tracker can feel limited, especially if you have many repositories.\n\nBut what if you wanted to see Issues from all sorts of repositories? \n## What is Res Publica?\n\n\nRes Publica is an open-source issue tracker that simplifies this process. We’ve unified GitHub Issues into one comprehensive view, making it easy to manage issues across different repositories.\n\nHosted on Vercel and using EdgeDB Cloud, Res Publica offers advanced filtering. You can sort issues by repository, labels, and more. Optimized for speed, our platform ensures a smooth experience, so you can focus on resolving issues efficiently.\n\n\n## What we implemented\nOur goal with Res Publica was ambitious. Despite some constraints, we’re thrilled with what we’ve achieved. Here are the key features:\n\n- [x] **GitHub Issues Integration**: Manage issues from multiple repositories easily.\n- [x] **Advanced Filtering**: Filter issues by repository, labels, and more.\n- [x] **Performance Optimization**: Fast access to issue data.\n- [x] **Open Source**: Fully open source, inviting contributions and transparency.\n- [ ] **AI Recommendations**: Use AI to suggest issues based on user preferences and skills.\n- [ ] **Senate Feature**: Let the community vote on new repositories to add.\n- [ ] **Community Initiatives**: Highlight repositories for increased visibility.\n\n\n## Leveraging Vercel's Capabilities\nOne challenge was displaying GitHub README files without overloading our database. We use Vercel’s data cache with a custom Octokit fetch. This caches README files efficiently on Vercel’s network, balancing performance and resource use.\n\n## Tech Stack\nRes Publica is built with a modern tech stack for reliability and scalability:\n\n- **Next.js**\n- **Edgedb**\n- **TRPC**\n- **TailwindCSS**\n- **Octokit**\n\n\n## The Dev Journey\n\nBuilding Res Publica was challenging but rewarding. The [Edgedb Hackathon](https://edgedb.com/hackathon) sparked our innovation. Though we faced time constraints, we laid a solid, promising foundation.\n\n\n## Future Plans\nOur journey with Res Publica is just beginning. We plan to integrate advanced features to enhance our platform:\n\n### AI issue recommendation\n\nWe aim to use AI for personalized issue recommendations. Factors include user library knowledge, preferred languages, and skill level. This will help users find suitable issues, boosting productivity.\n\n\n### Community-Driven Enhancements\n\nA thriving community is key for open-source success. We plan to introduce a senate system. The community will vote on new repositories and significant decisions. This ensures Res Publica evolves to meet user needs and preferences.\n***\n\nWe invite you to explore Res Publica. Contribute to its development and join us on this exciting journey. Together, we can simplify issue tracking and build a vibrant, collaborative open-source community.",
